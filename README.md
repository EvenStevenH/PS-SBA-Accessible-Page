## Reflection

Similar to the lab, the accessibility enhancements that were the most challenging to implement were the ARIA elements (ex. "aria-live"). They became difficult to track and know which ones were applicable. It's due to my not having heard of or ever using them before, so I addressed them by utilizing their documentation and looking at examples of usage as I was working on the project. I think I would learn to use them simply through repeated use, but I think it's still true to not actively seek using them outside of specific cases (ex. toggle switches, non-standard labels). There are native HTML elements or attributes that provide us with the semantics and behavior already built in, so additional ARIA components may potentially cause redundancy.

To ensure my design was responsive, I used Flexbox, CSS grid, and media queries. These allowed elements to be scaled and moved around based on a user's device. I used the "Live Preview" extension for VSCode to repeatedly test the visual states of my site by shrinking and enlarging it to simulate various widths. Then, I targeted accessibility by using semantic tags such as "main" and "section" to organize and give meaning to the content. I also used CSS to add focus states for interactive elements, such as buttons. Finally, I made sure the text had sufficient contrast ratio by using a helpful browser extension called "WCAG Color Contrast Checker".
